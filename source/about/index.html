  <h1 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">About me</h1>
  <p>UK and Australian citizen spending my time split between living in Europe and Chiang Mai, Thailand</p>
  <p>I left permanent employment in April 2018 after <a href="/katie-clark-resume.pdf" rel="section" target="_blank">9 years industry experience as a developer</a> and have started this blog for personal projects. It will probably consist mostly of Kaggle competitons, reflections on what I've learnt from previous employment, and anything new I learn along the way. Language focus will be on Python and JavaScript.</p>
