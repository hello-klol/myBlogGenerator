  <h1>Learning some JavaScript</h1>
  <p>
  I've been learning bits of JavaScript recently in order to build this blog. I want to try my hand at Reinforcement Learning so I 
  built this game in hope of training some AI to play it for me.

  For now, I've followed a 
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript" rel="external" target="_blank" style="color:#0095DD">
    tutorial by Mozilla</a> and tweaked the code here and there in hope of making it more readable. You can view the source
